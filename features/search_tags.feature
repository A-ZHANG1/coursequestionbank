Feature: User can search for questions by tags
  As an exam writer,
  So that I can ensure consistency between versions of tests,
  I want to easily find related questions tagged with the same topic

  As a student,
  So that I can practice topics I’m unconfident in,
  I want to easily find related questions tagged with the same topic

  As a UGSI,
  So that I can help students review material in discussion,
  I want to easily find related questions tagged with the same topic

  Scenario: search for matching questions by a specific tag

  Scenario: search by a tag that doesn’t match any questions (sad path)
